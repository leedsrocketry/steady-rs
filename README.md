# Steady-rs

Steady-rs is a rust library for interfacing with the [Silicdyne Fluctus flight computer](https://silicdyne.net/fluctus/) via the [Steady ground station](https://silicdyne.net/steadyblue/).

All it does is provide tools for reading data coming in via the Steady ground station's serial connection. There is no system for sending and receiving that data in the library. This may change.
